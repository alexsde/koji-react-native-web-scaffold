# Koji React Native Web + TypeScript Scaffold

-------

# What is React Native Web?

"React Native for Web" makes it possible to run React Native components and APIs on the web using React DOM. This makes it easy to create fast, adaptive web UIs in JavaScript. It provides native-quality interactions, support for multiple input modes (touch, mouse, keyboard), optimized vendor-prefixed styles, built-in support for RTL layout, built-in accessibility, and integrates with React Dev Tools.

More information and documentation can be found here: [React Native Web Repository](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).
